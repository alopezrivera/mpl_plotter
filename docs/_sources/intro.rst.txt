Making plots for technical documents can be a time sink. MPL Plotter aims to 
reduce that overhead by allowing you to effortlessly and concisely

- Generate publication quality figures with a single call
- Compare data by plotting different curves in a single plot
- Visualize different kinds of data in figures with many plots

It is opinionated but built with flexibility in mind, which practically means 
that no default can't be changed, and any and all further customization with 
Matplotlib is compatible. From ticks to legends to extra axes to whatever suits 
your needs. There's two ways to use MPL Plotter:

- Calls to the 2D and 3D plotting functions
- Using presets, either those shipped with the library, or custom ones

It does the job for me and I expand it when it can't. Hope you find some use in it!
